Odin Recipe HTML Project

DESC: The current project is to create a webpage that has a list(s) of recipes. 
In this project I will be using HTML in order to design the skeleton of the
website.

I am also using index.html for the css foundations exercises from TOP.

I will be using Ordered-Lists(OL), List Items (LI), and Unordered Lists (UL)
to create this project.
